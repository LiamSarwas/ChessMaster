// In chess, all moves require only a start location to an end location.
// While castling involves two pieces/moves, the movement of the
// king unabmiguously determines the start and end location of the rook.
// Therefore, a castling move is specified by the movement of the king only.

// Obviously, not all possible moves are valid.
// The validity of a move is determined by the rules of chess (Rules.swift),
// given the board position at the time of the move.

    return (lhs.start == rhs.start) && (lhs.end == rhs.end)
